# CraigslistShark
A fun little Discord bot that will help you find items to flip on craigslist!

Using `python-craigslist`
You can find it here at: https://github.com/juliomalegria/python-craigslist  
Also using `discord.py`!


## **Disclaimer**
> ***Note** this is still a work in progress. By no means is this ready, just began development*  
***Note 2** this is purely for educational purposes, craigslist TOS doesn't allow for bots and scrapers. This is just to learn, and have fun making something that could be useful. Deploying could mean violating TOS, which is bad. Don't be bad. pls*
